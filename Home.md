## [Complexity](teir1/Complexity.md)
Complexity is the study of the efficiency of algorithms, using big O notation to express their time and space requirements.

## [Recursion](teir1/Recursion.md)
Recursion is a method of solving a problem by defining a function that calls itself with simpler input values until it reaches a base case, at which point it can be solved directly.

## [Stacks and queues](teir1/Stacks%20and%20queues.md)
Stacks and queues are data structures that store and retrieve items in a particular order. Stacks use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, while queues use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.

## [Trees](teir1/Hashing.md)
Trees are data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. They have a hierarchical structure and can be used to store and organize data in many different ways.

## [Sorting](teir1/Sorting.md)
Sorting is the process of arranging a sequence of items in a particular order, such as ascending or descending.

## [Graphs](teir1/Graphs.md)
Graphs are data structures that consist of a set of vertices connected by edges. They can be used to represent relationships between objects and to find solutions to problems such as finding the shortest path between two points.

## [Hashing](teir1/Hashing.md)
Hashing is a technique for storing and retrieving data from a data structure called a hash table. It uses a hash function to map data to a specific location in the table, allowing for efficient insertion and retrieval of data.
